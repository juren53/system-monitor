Analysis of SysMon v0.0.9b code

[Note: all of these issues where encorporated into v0.0.9c]

The analysis found several issues in sysmon.py:

Critical Error:
- Line 538: Missing line continuation - will cause syntax error

Cause: The issue was that line 538 (and the entire file) had Windows line endings (\r\n) instead of Unix line endings (\n). This can cause various problems on Unix/Linux systems including:
1. Syntax interpretation issues - Python can sometimes have trouble with CRLF endings
2. Script execution problems - The shebang line may not work properly
3. Tool compatibility issues - Many Unix tools expect LF endings
The `dos2unix` command converted all the Windows line endings to Unix format, which should resolve the "missing line continuation" error you were experiencing. The file now has proper Unix line endings and compiles without syntax errors.

Logic Errors:
- Unused filter_data_by_time_window() method (lines 479-493)
- Inconsistent array length handling in smoothing logic
- Missing error handling in get_system_metrics() for psutil failures

Runtime Risks:
- Division by zero potential with very small time deltas
- Empty list unpacking in data filtering (lines 573-575, 610-613, 668-671)
- Inconsistent time window updates when using keyboard controls

Performance Issues:
- Unnecessary deque-to-list conversions throughout animate method
- Duplicate imports (os imported twice)

Best Practices:
- Magic numbers throughout (200, 0.2, 10, etc.)
- No constants for configuration values

The syntax error on line 538 is the most critical and will prevent execution.

Magic numbers can help sysmon.py by replacing hardcoded values with named constants for better maintainability and readability. Here are key areas where they'd be beneficial:

Data storage limits:
- Line 150-156: deque(maxlen=200) → MAX_DATA_POINTS = 200
- Line 175: figsize=(12, 8) → FIGURE_WIDTH = 12, FIGURE_HEIGHT = 8
Timing constants:
- Line 335: time.sleep(0.2) → PROCESS_SAMPLE_DELAY = 0.2
- Line 500: >= 1.0 → DATA_SAMPLE_INTERVAL = 1.0
- Line 707: interval=50 → ANIMATION_INTERVAL = 50
Threshold values:
- Line 303-310: Byte formatting thresholds (1024, 1024*1024, etc.)
- Line 316-323: Bit formatting thresholds (1000, 1000*1000, etc.)
- Line 625: max_val * 1.1 → Y_AXIS_PADDING = 1.1
Visual constants:
- Line 631: disk_flash_counter = 10 → FLASH_DURATION = 10
- Line 636: Color codes → named constants

Using magic numbers (named constants) would make the code more self-documenting and easier to modify when adjusting timing, thresholds, or visual parameters.
