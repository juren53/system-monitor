Features of the PyQtGraph library context menu, a built-in feature of PyQtGraph's plotting widgets.

 Here is a brief explanation of the options you are seeing:

   * View All: This option automatically adjusts the plot's axes to display all of the data you've plotted. It's a
     quick way to "zoom out" completely.
   * X Axis / Y Axis: These submenus allow you to control the behavior of the respective axes. You can often find
     options here to:
       * Enable/disable auto-scaling.
       * Link the axis with other plots.
       * Set logarithmic or linear scaling.
   * Mouse Mode: This lets you change how the mouse interacts with the plot. You can typically switch between:
       * 1-Button Mode: Left-click-drag to pan, and use the scroll wheel to zoom.
       * 3-Button Mode: Left-click-drag to zoom (by drawing a box), and middle-click or right-click-drag to pan. The
         exact behavior can vary slightly.
   * Plot Options: This menu often contains more advanced features for data analysis and visualization, such as:
       * Transformations: Applying transformations like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the data.
       * Grid: Toggling the visibility of the grid lines.

  For more detailed documentation, the official PyQtGraph documentation is the best place to go. The context menu is
  part of the PlotItem class. You can find more information about it and other features here:

   * PyQtGraph Documentation: https://www.pyqtgraph.org (https://www.pyqtgraph.org)
   * PlotItem Class: The documentation for the PlotItem will have details on its configuration: pyqtgraph.PlotItem
     documentation (https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graphicsItems/plotitem.html)
   * Examples: PyQtGraph comes with a comprehensive set of examples that are a great way to learn about its features
     interactively. If you run the examples from the library, you can experiment with these menus on different types
     of plots.

  Exploring the examples is often the fastest way to understand all the interactive features the library offers.
