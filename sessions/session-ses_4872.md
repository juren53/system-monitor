# Intro

Get started with OpenCode.

[**OpenCode**](/) is an open source AI coding agent. It’s available as a terminal-based interface, desktop app, or IDE extension.

![OpenCode TUI with the opencode theme](/docs/_astro/screenshot.Bs5D4atL_ZvsvFu.webp)

Let’s get started.

---

#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To use OpenCode in your terminal, you’ll need:

1.  A modern terminal emulator like:
    
    -   [WezTerm](https://wezterm.org), cross-platform
    -   [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org), cross-platform
    -   [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), Linux and macOS
    -   [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), Linux and macOS
2.  API keys for the LLM providers you want to use.
    

---

## [Install](#install)

The easiest way to install OpenCode is through the install script.

Terminal window

```
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

You can also install it with the following commands:

-   **Using Node.js**
    
    -   [npm](#tab-panel-0)
    -   [Bun](#tab-panel-1)
    -   [pnpm](#tab-panel-2)
    -   [Yarn](#tab-panel-3)
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    bun install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    pnpm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    yarn global add opencode-ai
    ```
    
-   **Using Homebrew on macOS and Linux**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    brew install opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using Paru on Arch Linux**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    paru -S opencode-bin
    ```
    

#### [Windows](#windows)

-   **Using Chocolatey**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    choco install opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using Scoop**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    scoop bucket add extrasscoop install extras/opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using NPM**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    
-   **Using Mise**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    mise use -g github:sst/opencode
    ```
    
-   **Using Docker**
    
    Terminal window
    
    ```
    docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/sst/opencode
    ```
    

Support for installing OpenCode on Windows using Bun is currently in progress.

You can also grab the binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/sst/opencode/releases).

---

## [Configure](#configure)

With OpenCode you can use any LLM provider by configuring their API keys.

If you are new to using LLM providers, we recommend using [OpenCode Zen](/docs/zen). It’s a curated list of models that have been tested and verified by the OpenCode team.

1.  Run the `/connect` command in the TUI, select opencode, and head to [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth).
    
    ```
    /connect
    ```
    
2.  Sign in, add your billing details, and copy your API key.
    
3.  Paste your API key.
    
    ```
    ┌ API key││└ enter
    ```
    

Alternatively, you can select one of the other providers. [Learn more](/docs/providers#directory).

---

## [Initialize](#initialize)

Now that you’ve configured a provider, you can navigate to a project that you want to work on.

Terminal window

```
cd /path/to/project
```

And run OpenCode.

Terminal window

```
opencode
```

Next, initialize OpenCode for the project by running the following command.

```
/init
```

This will get OpenCode to analyze your project and create an `AGENTS.md` file in the project root.

Tip

You should commit your project’s `AGENTS.md` file to Git.

This helps OpenCode understand the project structure and the coding patterns used.

---

## [Usage](#usage)

You are now ready to use OpenCode to work on your project. Feel free to ask it anything!

If you are new to using an AI coding agent, here are some examples that might help.

---

### [Ask questions](#ask-questions)

You can ask OpenCode to explain the codebase to you.

Tip

Use the `@` key to fuzzy search for files in the project.

```
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

This is helpful if there’s a part of the codebase that you didn’t work on.

---

### [Add features](#add-features)

You can ask OpenCode to add new features to your project. Though we first recommend asking it to create a plan.

1.  **Create a plan**
    
    OpenCode has a *Plan mode* that disables its ability to make changes and instead suggest *how* it’ll implement the feature.
    
    Switch to it using the **Tab** key. You’ll see an indicator for this in the lower right corner.
    
    ```
    <TAB>
    ```
    
    Now let’s describe what we want it to do.
    
    ```
    When a user deletes a note, we'd like to flag it as deleted in the database.Then create a screen that shows all the recently deleted notes.From this screen, the user can undelete a note or permanently delete it.
    ```
    
    You want to give OpenCode enough details to understand what you want. It helps to talk to it like you are talking to a junior developer on your team.
    
    Tip
    
    Give OpenCode plenty of context and examples to help it understand what you want.
    
2.  **Iterate on the plan**
    
    Once it gives you a plan, you can give it feedback or add more details.
    
    ```
    We'd like to design this new screen using a design I've used before.[Image #1] Take a look at this image and use it as a reference.
    ```
    
    Tip
    
    Drag and drop images into the terminal to add them to the prompt.
    
    OpenCode can scan any images you give it and add them to the prompt. You can do this by dragging and dropping an image into the terminal.
    
3.  **Build the feature**
    
    Once you feel comfortable with the plan, switch back to *Build mode* by hitting the **Tab** key again.
    
    ```
    <TAB>
    ```
    
    And asking it to make the changes.
    
    ```
    Sounds good! Go ahead and make the changes.
    ```
    

---

### [Make changes](#make-changes)

For more straightforward changes, you can ask OpenCode to directly build it without having to review the plan first.

```
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this ishandled in the /notes route in @packages/functions/src/notes.ts and implementthe same logic in @packages/functions/src/settings.ts
```

You want to make sure you provide a good amount of detail so OpenCode makes the right changes.

---

### [Undo changes](#undo-changes)

Let’s say you ask OpenCode to make some changes.

```
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

But you realize that it is not what you wanted. You **can undo** the changes using the `/undo` command.

```
/undo
```

OpenCode will now revert the changes you made and show your original message again.

```
Can you refactor the function in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

From here you can tweak the prompt and ask OpenCode to try again.

Tip

You can run `/undo` multiple times to undo multiple changes.

Or you **can redo** the changes using the `/redo` command.

```
/redo
```

---

## [Share](#share)

The conversations that you have with OpenCode can be [shared with your team](/docs/share).

```
/share
```

This will create a link to the current conversation and copy it to your clipboard.

Note

Conversations are not shared by default.

Here’s an [example conversation](https://opencode.ai/s/4XP1fce5) with OpenCode.

---

## [Customize](#customize)

And that’s it! You are now a pro at using OpenCode.

To make it your own, we recommend [picking a theme](/docs/themes), [customizing the keybinds](/docs/keybinds), [configuring code formatters](/docs/formatters), [creating custom commands](/docs/commands), or playing around with the [OpenCode config](/docs/config).

Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the SysMon codebase. Let me analyze the architecture and identify refactoring opportunities.

# SysMon Codebase Architecture Analysis

## Current Architecture Overview

SysMon is a single-file PyQt5 application (~3800 lines) that provides real-time system monitoring with CPU, Disk I/O, and Network activity graphs. The application follows a monolithic architecture where all functionality is contained within one file.

### Main Classes and Their Responsibilities

#### 1. **ProcessWorker** (lines 241-373)
- **Purpose**: Async process analysis worker
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - CPU measurement with two-pass approach
  - Disk I/O and network connection analysis
  - Progress reporting and cancellation support
- **Issues**: Long method (132 lines), mixed responsibilities

#### 2. **ProcessInfoDialog** (lines 375-397)
- **Purpose**: Legacy static process display dialog
- **Responsibilities**: Simple text display of top processes
- **Issues**: Minimal functionality, could be replaced

#### 3. **ConfigFileViewerDialog** (lines 399-481)
- **Purpose**: Read-only configuration file viewer
- **Responsibilities**: Display config files in tabs
- **Issues**: Repetitive UI setup code

#### 4. **RealTimeProcessDialog** (lines 483-766)
- **Purpose**: Live CPU process monitoring dialog
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Real-time table updates
  - Process filtering
  - Update interval control
- **Issues**: 283 lines, mixed UI and business logic

#### 5. **RealTimeDiskDialog** (lines 768-1064)
- **Purpose**: Live disk I/O monitoring dialog
- **Issues**: 296 lines, significant code duplication with RealTimeProcessDialog

#### 6. **DiskIOWorker** (lines 1066-1153)
- **Purpose**: Async disk I/O rate calculation
- **Issues**: Complex rate calculation logic mixed with data collection

#### 7. **RealTimeNetworkDialog** (lines 1155-1452)
- **Purpose**: Live network connection monitoring dialog
- **Issues**: 297 lines, massive code duplication with other real-time dialogs

#### 8. **NetworkWorker** (lines 1454-1525)
- **Purpose**: Async network connection analysis
- **Issues**: Similar pattern to other workers

#### 9. **SystemMonitor** (lines 1527-3736)
- **Purpose**: Main application window
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - UI setup and management
  - Data collection and plotting
  - Configuration management
  - Theme handling
  - Menu system
  - All user interactions
- **Issues**: Massive monolithic class (2209 lines), violates Single Responsibility Principle

## Code Quality Issues Identified

### 1. **Massive Single File Architecture**
- **Problem**: 3800 lines in one file
- **Impact**: Poor maintainability, difficult navigation, testing challenges
- **Lines**: Entire file

### 2. **Monolithic SystemMonitor Class**
- **Problem**: 2209 lines, handles everything
- **Impact**: Violates SRP, tightly coupled, hard to test
- **Lines**: 1527-3736

### 3. **Code Duplication in Real-Time Dialogs**
- **Problem**: RealTimeProcessDialog, RealTimeDiskDialog, RealTimeNetworkDialog share 80% of code
- **Impact**: Maintenance nightmare, inconsistent behavior
- **Lines**: 483-766, 768-1064, 1155-1452

### 4. **Long Methods**
- **ProcessWorker.run()**: 132 lines (256-373)
- **SystemMonitor.setup_ui()**: 193 lines (1650-1843)
- **SystemMonitor.render_markdown_to_html()**: 183 lines (1838-2021)
- **SystemMonitor.apply_application_theme()**: 50 lines (1782-1831)

### 5. **Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Values**
```python
# Lines 261, 286, 490, 528, 530, 776, 818, 863, 864, 865, 866, 867
max_processes = 200  # Line 261
time.sleep(0.5)     # Line 286
self.update_interval = 3000  # Line 490
self.interval_spinbox.setMinimum(1)   # Line 528
self.interval_spinbox.setMaximum(60)  # Line 530
```

### 6. **Mixed Concerns in Methods**
- UI setup mixed with business logic
- Data collection mixed with display logic
- Configuration handling scattered throughout

### 7. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
- Some methods use try/catch, others don't
- Inconsistent error reporting patterns
- Silent failures in some areas

## Coupling and Cohesion Problems

### 1. **Tight Coupling**
- **SystemMonitor** directly creates and manages all dialogs
- **Real-time dialogs** tightly coupled to specific worker classes
- **UI components** directly access data storage

### 2. **Poor Cohesion**
- **SystemMonitor** handles UI, data, config, themes, menus
- **Worker classes** mix data collection with formatting
- **Dialog classes** mix UI setup with business logic

### 3. **Dependency Issues**
- Circular imports would occur if split improperly
- Hard-coded dependencies throughout
- No dependency injection pattern

## Areas Needing Improvement

### 1. **Architecture Restructuring**
- Extract separate modules for different concerns
- Implement proper MVC/MVP pattern
- Create service layer for business logic

### 2. **Dialog Base Class**
- Create abstract base class for real-time dialogs
- Extract common functionality (filtering, timing, UI)
- Reduce code duplication by 80%

### 3. **Configuration Management**
- Create dedicated configuration manager
- Centralize all preference handling
- Implement observer pattern for config changes

### 4. **Theme System**
- Extract theme management to separate class
- Create theme factory pattern
- Separate theme detection from application

### 5. **Data Management**
- Create data model classes
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Separate data collection from display

### 6. **Worker Pattern Standardization**
- Create base worker class
- Standardize progress reporting
- Implement common cancellation mechanism

## Specific Problematic Code Sections

### 1. **SystemMonitor.__init__()** (lines 1528-1603)
```python
# 75 lines of mixed initialization
# UI setup, data storage, configuration loading, timer setup
# Should be split into focused methods
```

### 2. **Real-Time Dialog Code Duplication**
```python
# Lines 510-594 (RealTimeProcessDialog.setup_ui)
# Lines 799-882 (RealTimeDiskDialog.setup_ui) 
# Lines 1182-1268 (RealTimeNetworkDialog.setup_ui)
# Nearly identical UI setup code with only column differences
```

### 3. **ProcessWorker.run()** (lines 256-373)
```python
# 132 lines handling CPU, disk, and network analysis
# Complex branching logic mixed with data collection
# Should be split into separate methods or classes
```

### 4. **SystemMonitor.update_data()** (lines 2253-2310)
```python
# Data collection, rate calculations, memory updates, plot updates
# Mixed concerns in single method called every 200ms
```

### 5. **Theme Application Code** (lines 2023-2084)
```python
# Repetitive color application to each plot
# Should use iteration or configuration-driven approach
```

## Recommended Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Service Classes
- ConfigurationManager
- ThemeManager  
- DataManager
- PlotManager

### Phase 2: Create Base Classes
- BaseRealTimeDialog
- BaseWorker
- BasePlotWidget

### Phase 3: Split SystemMonitor
- MainWindow (UI only)
- MonitoringController (business logic)
- EventHandlers (user interactions)

### Phase 4: Standardize Workers
- Unified worker interface
- Common progress reporting
- Standardized cancellation

This analysis reveals that while SysMon is functionally complete, it suffers from significant architectural issues that impact maintainability, testability, and extensibility. The monolithic structure and extensive code duplication make it an ideal candidate for systematic refactoring.
